# TwitchBot
Allows keypresses to be read from twitch chat and activated on local computer

Currently works for OS X. Update and implement keyPress.py's KeyDown and KeyUp methods for any other OS. 

NOTE: This gives users limited control of the keyboard of the computer you run this code on. Don't be stupid!
